	This file basically does the same thing as the GeneDefs_StatOffsets.xml, but labels it as x999 instead of +99900%, they probably are additive(or multiplicative) and could easily lead to overflow numbers.
	
	Disabled for now, but essentially all GeneDefs in the GeneDefs_StatOffsets.xml file could be placed in here, changing the appropriate tags and names so they aren't the same and error out
